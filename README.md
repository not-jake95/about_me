# about_me
This is a page about me.

My name is Jake Millinoff. I'm 21 years old and I live here in Windsor, Ontario but I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I take interest in pretty much anything car-related, especially if it has to do with Japanese or modified cars. My hobbies include working on my own and friends' cars, playing sports like soccer, tennis, and football. I also enjoy trying new restaurants around Windsor and Detroit with friends.
